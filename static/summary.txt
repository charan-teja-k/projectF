Customer feedback reveals both high satisfaction with service quality and recurring logistics issues impacting product experience.  

•	Strong praise for responsive customer service and support effectiveness
•	Significant recurring problems with late deliveries and damaged packaging
•	Product mismatches (incorrect/defective items, color discrepancies) frequent
•	Positive comments on product quality/value and ease of returns conflict with dissatisfaction
•	Website navigation receives praise, while checkout process causes confusion  

Prioritize immediate investigation and improvement of shipping, packaging, and inventory accuracy processes.
